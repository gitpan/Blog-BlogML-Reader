Blog-BlogML-Reader version 0.01
===============================

BlogML is a standard for XML to define and store an entire blog. This module 
allows you to easily read most data in a given BlogML file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

XML::Parser::Expat
This module uses XML::Parser::Expat to parse the XML in the BlogML source file.
I chose an expat based parser primarily for its speed. Check the docs for 
XML::Parser::Expat for further dependencies.

HTTP::Date
This module uses HTTP::Date to transform date strings into sortable timestamps.
Neccessary when, for example, sorting blog posts and retrieving the most
recent.
